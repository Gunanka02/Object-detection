# Object-detection
This project is designed to enhance the integrity of online quizzes or exams by detecting the use of mobile phones during the session. It leverages computer vision techniques, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once), a pre-trained object detection model, to monitor the video feed in real-time and identify any phones visible in the camera's view.
